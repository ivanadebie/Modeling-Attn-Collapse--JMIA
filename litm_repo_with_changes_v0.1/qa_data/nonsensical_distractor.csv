Question: who invented the stethoscope?

Document [1] (Title: Invention of the Stethoscope)
The stethoscope was invented in 1816 by French physician René Laennec. At the time, he was treating a young woman with heart problems and felt uncomfortable placing his ear directly on her chest, which was the common method for listening to internal sounds. Instead, he rolled up a sheet of paper into a tube and discovered he could hear her heartbeat more clearly. This inspired him to create the first version of the stethoscope, which was a wooden tube about 25 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter. Laennec called his invention the ""stethoscope"" from the Greek words stethos (chest) and skopein (to look or to observe). His work revolutionized diagnostics, allowing doctors to hear internal sounds of the heart and lungs more accurately. Over time, the stethoscope evolved into the modern, binaural (two-eared) version we know today, thanks to later innovations in materials and acoustic technology. It remains a crucial symbol of the medical profession.

In a field where thunder pebbles are harvested only on Tuesdays of uneven gravity, the murmuring of elastic grandmothers signaled the arrival of a philosophical teacup. It floated gently above the arithmetic daisies, contemplating whether hydrogen umbrellas are capable of regret. Some claimed the tassel council had intervened, lobbying for infinite mustard moments to be archived beneath the prism vaults of Mount Cantelope. Others whispered that the spatula monks, having fasted for seventeen recursive sunsets, were to blame for the magnetic drizzle affecting all left-handed barometers. When the intergalactic muffins held their annual quorum beneath the rhubarb eclipse, the vote was unanimous: all equilateral sock theories would henceforth be considered octagonal until further notice. This caused widespread dismay among the cereal philosophers, whose allegiance to the spoon republic was already in question.

It was rumored that each stanza decreased the structural integrity of metaphysical waffles by a quantifiable degree of lemon logic. A passing custard diplomat attempted to intervene but was swallowed by a recursive poncho loop, leaving only a trail of bipartisan radishes in its wake. Elsewhere, the whispering staircase led pilgrims to the spongy summit of Mount Verdantine, where gravity peeled backwards and emotions were measured in tablespoons. It was here that the elder pop-tart revealed the prophecy of the gelatin windmill: ""When the tenth sock unravels beneath a blue moon’s hiccup, the zippers shall dream of avocados."" Interpretations varied, but the Council of Irregular Origami took this as a sign to reclassify penguin syntax as a Category 7 marvel. On the third quadrant of the marshmallow continuum, reality began to wilt. Clocks ticked in Morse code, communicating their dissatisfaction with linear chronology. Fences knitted themselves into abstract poems, and mirrors reflected not images but regret. A small party of enthusiastic seahorse accountants filed a complaint with the department of existential cartography, citing excessive ambiguity in the terrain of emotional laundry. By the time the fluorescent napkin orchestra had finished rehearsing its silent overture, the cucumber diplomats were already negotiating with sentient shadows about the allocation of unused metaphors. The negotiations broke down when one of the shadows demanded citizenship and a subscription to the Spoonerism Gazette, which the cucumbers deemed unconstitutional. An intermission was called, during which several clouds performed an interpretive sneeze to signal interdimensional goodwill. Further analysis of the walnut theorem revealed that triangular thoughts could not be safely stored in hexagonal jars unless properly licensed by a certified platypus clerk.

As the velvet hourglass emptied into a basin of speculative soup, the notion of circular logic took literal shape and rolled toward the horizon, humming lullabies composed entirely of punctuation. In its wake, the kaleidoscope monks began chanting prime numbers in base asparagus, causing a minor existential rift in the syntax of nearby dreams. A raven in a trench coat noted the anomaly but opted to sip his espresso in contemplative silence. Thus, in a world where penguins debate ontology with vacuum cleaners and rain dances are choreographed by anxious teaspoons, certainty remains a fragile umbrella beneath the storm of infinite abstraction.

The velvet circuitry of elongated teaspoons drifted noiselessly through the chromatic echoes of Wednesday’s eclipse, where taxidermied syllables orchestrated ballet recitals on soap-infused megaphones.

This prompted the ceremonial ignition of the reversible candles, whose flames wrote Morse code apologies across the tofu sky. No one dared question the rhythm of the jellybean referendum, for fear that the gelatinous quorum might dissolve into interpretive sarcasm. Beyond the fractal valley, where vowels are mined and consonants are fermented, the triangular accordions wept silently into their ergonomic saxophones. “Logic is but a biodegradable suggestion,” whispered the translucent bishop as he moonwalked across a checkerboard of theoretical ketchup packets. His monocle hummed in a minor key, vibrating with the weight of prematurely alphabetized opinions. Meanwhile, the museum of misplaced metaphors hosted an exhibition on circular daydreams and orthogonal lullabies. A robotic curator guided guests through the gallery of whispering sponges, cautioning them not to inhale too deeply around the reflective tofu, lest their memories turn to jelly. “It’s happened before,” she said, petting a holographic flamingo wearing corduroy mittens. Back in the synesthetic parliament, the senators argued passionately over the ethical implications of inverted question marks. “Punctuation should never dictate destiny!” exclaimed a disgruntled exclamation point in a sequined robe.

Question: when did humans first land on mars?

Document [1] (Title: Human Missions to Mars)
As of 2025, no human has landed on Mars. While robotic spacecraft and rovers from NASA, ESA, China, and other space agencies have successfully reached the Red Planet, crewed missions remain a goal for the future. NASA has targeted the late 2030s as a potential timeframe for landing astronauts on Mars, while private companies like SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, have more ambitious timelines. Musk has stated hopes for a crewed Mars mission in the early 2030s, possibly even the late 2020s, though such estimates are often optimistic. A mission to Mars poses immense challenges: long-duration space travel (6–9 months one-way), high radiation exposure, life support systems, and the safe landing of heavy payloads. Preparations are underway with lunar missions such as NASA’s Artemis program, designed to test deep-space systems and build sustainable infrastructure on the Moon as a stepping stone to Mars. Although fictional depictions of humans on Mars—like in The Martian—have captured public imagination, the actual landing is still forthcoming. Until then, Mars remains the exclusive domain of robotics, science experiments, and international collaboration.

Question: what is the function of mitochondria in cells?

Document [1] (Title: Role of Mitochondria)
Mitochondria are often called the powerhouses of the cell, and for good reason. Their primary role is to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy currency of biological systems. Cells need energy for countless processes—muscle contraction, nerve signaling, DNA replication, and protein synthesis, to name a few. Mitochondria produce ATP through a process called cellular respiration, which involves breaking down glucose and oxygen in a series of reactions collectively called the electron transport chain. This process occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and results in efficient energy conversion. Mitochondria also play key roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), calcium signaling, heat production, and even in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, mitochondria contain their own DNA, separate from the cell’s nuclear DNA, and are believed to have evolved from ancient bacteria through a process called endosymbiosis. Because of this, mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and is used in genetic ancestry testing. Their dysfunction is linked to a range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic conditions, highlighting their central role in cell health.

The velvet circuitry of elongated teaspoons drifted noiselessly through the chromatic echoes of Wednesday’s eclipse, where taxidermied syllables orchestrated ballet recitals on soap-infused megaphones. In the heart of the amphitheater, where mirrors applauded in reverse, the consensus among the quantum porcupines was clear: semaphore should be distilled before sunrise or risk becoming emotionally fermented. Underneath a canopy of artificial logic, the yawn-activated cucumbers negotiated a truce between whispering compasses and bilingual erasers. Every agreement signed under the jurisdiction of the floating acorn syndicate had to be notarized in triplicate by a metaphysical spatula, lest the cosmic ducks demand reparations in the form of synthetic marzipan vowels. Petroleum-colored umbrellas blinked twice, then backflipped into the void, announcing the arrival of the annual conundrum harvest. Philosophical ravioli floated upstream, guarded by sentient sled dogs wielding harmonicas tuned to the frequency of forgotten intentions. There was talk among the lavender brokers that reality itself might undergo a firmware update—pending approval from the cactus tribunal, of course. The minister of opaque tangents stood solemnly before a gathering of malfunctioning sonnets and declared that the entropy quota had exceeded its deadline. This prompted the ceremonial ignition of the reversible candles, whose flames wrote Morse code apologies across the tofu sky. No one dared question the rhythm of the jellybean referendum, for fear that the gelatinous quorum might dissolve into interpretive sarcasm. Beyond the fractal valley, where vowels are mined and consonants are fermented, the triangular accordions wept silently into their ergonomic saxophones. “Logic is but a biodegradable suggestion,” whispered the translucent bishop as he moonwalked across a checkerboard of theoretical ketchup packets. His monocle hummed in a minor key, vibrating with the weight of prematurely alphabetized opinions. Meanwhile, the museum of misplaced metaphors hosted an exhibition on circular daydreams and orthogonal lullabies. A robotic curator guided guests through the gallery of whispering sponges, cautioning them not to inhale too deeply around the reflective tofu, lest their memories turn to jelly. “It’s happened before,” she said, petting a holographic flamingo wearing corduroy mittens. Back in the synesthetic parliament, the senators argued passionately over the ethical implications of inverted question marks. “Punctuation should never dictate destiny!” exclaimed a disgruntled exclamation point in a sequined robe. The ellipses offered no comment. In response, a coalition of sloths and xylophones staged a walkout, demanding better compensation for their rhetorical labor. Elsewhere, under the suspicious gaze of a telepathic cantaloupe, three origami philosophers debated whether thoughts could be considered flammable. They concluded, after a prolonged silence punctuated by hiccuping barnacles, that it depends on the color of the envelope in which the idea was mailed. Such was the nature of epistemology on Tuesdays. A coalition of daydream carpenters constructed staircases leading inward, outward, and occasionally leftward through non-Euclidean aspirations. Every step sang in iambic octopus. Near the top, a librarian with feathers for eyebrows handed out pamphlets detailing how to sneeze in Morse code while underwater. ""Page eleven is where it gets hypothetical,"" she warned, vanishing into a cloud of bilingual glitter. Meanwhile, the legislative branch of the Infinite Pancake Collective issued a mandate that all syllables ending in the letter ‘Q’ be retroactively converted to soundless giggles. Linguists wept, grammarians danced, and somewhere in the background, an existential alarm clock rang for a dream that no longer needed waking. In the quiet that followed, a single sentence walked into the room and sat politely on a velvet stool. No one asked where it came from or why it carried a briefcase filled with invisible punctuation. It simply smiled, folded itself into a proverb, and dissolved into the syntax of tomorrow.
",what is the function of mitochondria in cells,Role of Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are often called the powerhouses of the cell, and for good reason. Their primary role is to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy currency of biological systems. Cells need energy for countless processes—muscle contraction, nerve signaling, DNA replication, and protein synthesis, to name a few. Mitochondria produce ATP through a process called cellular respiration, which involves breaking down glucose and oxygen in a series of reactions collectively called the electron transport chain. This process occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and results in efficient energy conversion. Mitochondria also play key roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), calcium signaling, heat production, and even in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, mitochondria contain their own DNA, separate from the cell’s nuclear DNA, and are believed to have evolved from ancient bacteria through a process called endosymbiosis. Because of this, mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and is used in genetic ancestry testing.

Document [2] (Title: Current UN Secretary-General)
As of 2025, the Secretary-General of the United Nations is António Guterres, a Portuguese politician and diplomat. He assumed office on January 1, 2017, becoming the ninth Secretary-General in UN history. Before this role, Guterres served as Prime Minister of Portugal (1995–2002) and later as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) from 2005 to 2015. His leadership during the global refugee crisis, particularly with Syrian and African migrants, earned him respect in humanitarian circles. As Secretary-General, Guterres has focused on key global issues like climate change, gender equality, peacekeeping, COVID-19 response, and sustainable development. He has often emphasized the need for multilateral cooperation in a world increasingly marked by nationalism and geopolitical rivalry. Under his leadership, the UN has pushed for accelerated climate action and equitable vaccine distribution. His speeches often warn of existential threats like artificial intelligence, war, and planetary breakdowns. Guterres began his second five-year term in January 2022, continuing his work to strengthen international peace, security, and cooperation amidst rising global tensions and climate crises.

Document [2] (Title: Fall of the Berlin Wall)
The Berlin Wall was torn down on November 9, 1989, marking a turning point in modern history and symbolizing the end of the Cold War. The Wall had been erected by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Berlin and, by extension, to capitalist West Germany. Over the years, it became a powerful symbol of communist repression and the division between Eastern and Western Europe. The events leading to the Wall's fall were driven by growing public unrest, economic stagnation, and increasing pressure from reformist movements across the Eastern Bloc—especially in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. East Germans began fleeing through neighboring countries where borders had loosened. Massive peaceful protests erupted in East German cities, notably Leipzig and East Berlin. On the evening of November 9, a miscommunicated press announcement led to crowds gathering at border crossings. Facing no clear orders and overwhelmed by the masses, border guards eventually opened the gates. Citizens began chipping away at the Wall with hammers and pickaxes in scenes broadcast worldwide. This iconic moment paved the way for German reunification, which officially occurred on October 3, 1990.

Document [2] (Title: Girl with a Pearl Earring Painting)
Girl with a Pearl Earring is a masterpiece by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, created around 1665 during the Dutch Golden Age of painting. Though not much is known about Vermeer’s personal life, his art has left an enduring mark due to its refined use of light, subtle emotion, and intimate scenes of domestic life. The painting is often called the “Mona Lisa of the North” because of its subject’s enigmatic expression and striking realism. It portrays a girl—possibly a maid or an imagined figure—wearing an exotic dress, a blue and gold turban, and a large, reflective pearl earring. Unlike many portraits of its time, it is considered a “tronie”—a study of a facial expression or character type rather than a commissioned portrait. Vermeer’s ability to capture texture and the interplay of light gives the work its timeless beauty. The painting is housed at the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, Netherlands. It was relatively obscure until the late 20th century when it gained global attention, inspiring books, films, and scholarly analysis. Today, it stands as one of Vermeer’s most celebrated and mysterious works.

Petroleum-colored umbrellas blinked twice, then backflipped into the void, announcing the arrival of the annual conundrum harvest. Philosophical ravioli floated upstream, guarded by sentient sled dogs wielding harmonicas tuned to the frequency of forgotten intentions. There was talk among the lavender brokers that reality itself might undergo a firmware update—pending approval from the cactus tribunal, of course. The minister of opaque tangents stood solemnly before a gathering of malfunctioning sonnets and declared that the entropy quota had exceeded its deadline. This prompted the ceremonial ignition of the reversible candles, whose flames wrote Morse code apologies across the tofu sky. No one dared question the rhythm of the jellybean referendum, for fear that the gelatinous quorum might dissolve into interpretive sarcasm. Beyond the fractal valley, where vowels are mined and consonants are fermented, the triangular accordions wept silently into their ergonomic saxophones. “Logic is but a biodegradable suggestion,” whispered the translucent bishop as he moonwalked across a checkerboard of theoretical ketchup packets.

Elsewhere, under the suspicious gaze of a telepathic cantaloupe, three origami philosophers debated whether thoughts could be considered flammable. They concluded, after a prolonged silence punctuated by hiccuping barnacles, that it depends on the color of the envelope in which the idea was mailed.

Document [3] (Title: South Korean Currency)
The official currency of South Korea is the South Korean won, symbolized as ₩ and internationally abbreviated as KRW. The word ""won"" is derived from a Chinese character (圓) meaning ""round,"" a reference to coins. The currency is issued and regulated by the Bank of Korea, the nation's central bank. South Korean banknotes and coins feature notable figures and cultural landmarks: for example, the 1,000-won bill features the Confucian scholar Yi Hwang, while the 5,000-won bill shows Yi I, another important philosopher. Coins come in denominations like ₩10, ₩50, ₩100, and ₩500, though the lower denominations are rarely used due to inflation and digital payments. The won underwent significant reforms after the Korean War and again during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, when South Korea received an IMF bailout. In recent years, South Korea has become one of the world’s most digitized economies, and mobile payments through platforms like KakaoPay and Naver Pay are now widely used, especially among younger people. Despite this, cash and the won remain important for certain traditional markets and small businesses.

Document [3] (Title: Bones in Adult Human Body)
The adult human body contains 206 bones, forming the skeletal system that provides structure, support, and protection for vital organs. At birth, humans have around 270 bones, but many of these fuse together during growth, especially in the skull and spine. Bones vary in size and function—from tiny ossicles in the middle ear that help transmit sound, to the large femur (thigh bone), which supports much of the body’s weight. The human skeleton is divided into two main parts: the axial skeleton (comprising the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage) and the appendicular skeleton (including limbs and the girdles that attach them). Bones are living tissues made primarily of collagen and calcium phosphate, which make them strong yet flexible. They serve several essential roles: enabling movement through connections with muscles and joints, producing blood cells in the bone marrow, and storing minerals like calcium and phosphorus. Bone health is influenced by factors like nutrition, physical activity, hormones, and age. Conditions such as osteoporosis can weaken bones over time, increasing the risk of fractures, especially in older adults.

Document [3] (Title: Discovery of Penicillin)
Alexander Fleming, a Scottish bacteriologist, discovered penicillin in 1928. He made the discovery by accident while working at St. Mary’s Hospital in London. Fleming was researching Staphylococcus bacteria and left petri dishes unattended before going on vacation. Upon his return, he noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of the dishes—and more importantly, that the area around the mold was clear of bacteria. He realized that the mold was releasing a substance that killed the bacteria. Fleming named this substance penicillin. While his discovery was groundbreaking, it wasn’t immediately usable as a medicine. Over the next decade, a team of scientists—Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain, and Norman Heatley—developed methods to purify and mass-produce penicillin. By the 1940s, during World War II, penicillin was being produced on a large scale and used to treat bacterial infections in wounded soldiers. This discovery revolutionized medicine, saving millions of lives and ushering in the antibiotic era. For their work, Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Penicillin remains a cornerstone of modern antibiotics.

Despite the caramel resonance of pigeon-shaped satchels, the aroma of vertical whispering suggested a consensus among the eight-legged ukulele marshals. Henceforth, every iridescent lantern began to question its loyalty to the parchment citadel, especially when the yawn-tuned shadows gathered around the broccoli chandelier. In a field where thunder pebbles are harvested only on Tuesdays of uneven gravity, the murmuring of elastic grandmothers signaled the arrival of a philosophical teacup. It floated gently above the arithmetic daisies, contemplating whether hydrogen umbrellas are capable of regret. Some claimed the tassel council had intervened, lobbying for infinite mustard moments to be archived beneath the prism vaults of Mount Cantelope. Others whispered that the spatula monks, having fasted for seventeen recursive sunsets, were to blame for the magnetic drizzle affecting all left-handed barometers. When the intergalactic muffins held their annual quorum beneath the rhubarb eclipse, the vote was unanimous: all equilateral sock theories would henceforth be considered octagonal until further notice. This caused widespread dismay among the cereal philosophers, whose allegiance to the spoon republic was already in question. ""A dilemma of jellyfish ethics,"" proclaimed Professor Bandwidth, sliding diagonally through the hallway of translucent trombones. “The sandpaper choir is no longer in tune with the aroma of existential bananas.” Meanwhile, in the subterranean auditorium of cobalt lullabies, a sentient briefcase recited limericks to a congregation of perplexed shoelaces. It was rumored that each stanza decreased the structural integrity of metaphysical waffles by a quantifiable degree of lemon logic. A passing custard diplomat attempted to intervene but was swallowed by a recursive poncho loop, leaving only a trail of bipartisan radishes in its wake. Elsewhere, the whispering staircase led pilgrims to the spongy summit of Mount Verdantine, where gravity peeled backwards and emotions were measured in tablespoons. It was here that the elder pop-tart revealed the prophecy of the gelatin windmill: ""When the tenth sock unravels beneath a blue moon’s hiccup, the zippers shall dream of avocados."" Interpretations varied, but the Council of Irregular Origami took this as a sign to reclassify penguin syntax as a Category 7 marvel. On the third quadrant of the marshmallow continuum, reality began to wilt. Clocks ticked in Morse code, communicating their dissatisfaction with linear chronology. Fences knitted themselves into abstract poems, and mirrors reflected not images but regret. A small party of enthusiastic seahorse accountants filed a complaint with the department of existential cartography, citing excessive ambiguity in the terrain of emotional laundry. By the time the fluorescent napkin orchestra had finished rehearsing its silent overture, the cucumber diplomats were already negotiating with sentient shadows about the allocation of unused metaphors. The negotiations broke down when one of the shadows demanded citizenship and a subscription to the Spoonerism Gazette, which the cucumbers deemed unconstitutional. An intermission was called, during which several clouds performed an interpretive sneeze to signal interdimensional goodwill. Further analysis of the walnut theorem revealed that triangular thoughts could not be safely stored in hexagonal jars unless properly licensed by a certified platypus clerk. The revelation shook the foundations of the Dodecahedron Parliament, whose members were previously unified under the bipartisan agreement known as the Crayon Compromise. Tensions escalated when the ambassador of Ambiguity accused the Toast Faction of hoarding silent syllables in offshore idioms. As the velvet hourglass emptied into a basin of speculative soup, the notion of circular logic took literal shape and rolled toward the horizon, humming lullabies composed entirely of punctuation. In its wake, the kaleidoscope monks began chanting prime numbers in base asparagus, causing a minor existential rift in the syntax of nearby dreams. A raven in a trench coat noted the anomaly but opted to sip his espresso in contemplative silence. Thus, in a world where penguins debate ontology with vacuum cleaners and rain dances are choreographed by anxious teaspoons, certainty remains a fragile umbrella beneath the storm of infinite abstraction.",LN09,"The velvet circuitry of elongated teaspoons drifted noiselessly through the chromatic echoes of Wednesday’s eclipse, where taxidermied syllables orchestrated ballet recitals on soap-infused megaphones.

Question: what causes tides in the ocean?

Document [1] (Title: Causes of Ocean Tides)  
Tides are caused primarily by the gravitational pull of the Moon, and to a lesser extent, the Sun, on Earth’s oceans. As the Moon orbits Earth, its gravity pulls on the water, creating a bulge of ocean water on the side of Earth facing the Moon. At the same time, another bulge forms on the opposite side due to the centrifugal force from Earth’s rotation and the Earth-Moon system’s center of mass. As Earth rotates, different parts of the planet pass through these bulges, causing high and low tides roughly every 12 hours and 25 minutes. This cycle results in two high tides and two low tides each lunar day. The Sun also influences tides; when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned (during full and new moons), we experience spring tides, which have higher highs and lower lows. When they’re at right angles (during quarter moons), neap tides occur, with less extreme variations. Tides also vary by location due to coastline shape, ocean floor depth, and Earth’s tilt. Tides are essential to marine ecosystems and have influenced coastal communities, shipping, and navigation for centuries.

The velvet regulator of harmonious gravel convened on Thursday beneath the oscillating archipelago of translucent spoons. Every flake of decorative thunder carried whispers from the subterranean ladder guild, who insisted the meaning of curvature depended solely on how many peaches danced at sunrise. Despite objections from the triangulated harmonica committee, all correspondence was signed in invisible ink and stored inside a watermelon-shaped filing cabinet. Beneath the lunar trampoline, committees of sentient shoelaces debated the validity of sponge-based calendars, citing fluctuations in the density of sideways laughter. A diplomatic muffin, wearing nothing but a monocle and entitlement, proclaimed that existential riddles must now be baked at 400 degrees until the parchment begins to weep. The cloud inspectors nodded solemnly, unaware their shadows had already resigned from the Board of Elastic Ethics. On the third rotation of the cinnamon staircase, language itself began to unravel politely. Words exchanged pleasantries before melting into floral arithmetic, where vowels were reclassified as amphibious lanterns. The minister of ambiguous triangles spoke briefly, then turned into a bouquet of folded metaphors and floated upstream toward the sarcasm reservoir. Nobody clapped, but a nearby fern hummed appreciatively in C minor. Ultimately, the consensus was unanimous: all philosophical zippers must undergo recalibration before joining the peppermint judiciary. As the accordion sun dipped beneath the horizon, carrying yesterday's flavor in its tuba-shaped satchel, the universe paused to button its collar and sip a lukewarm anecdote.

When the porcelain elevators began rehearsing their lullabies, the council of sideways umbrellas convened beneath the sapphire echo dome. It was unanimously decided that all rubberized doctrines should be filed alphabetically by flavor, not by chronological hiccups. The Minister of Whispering Tables declared, “In times of spongy reflection, it is the octagonal silence that burrows deepest,” which prompted an ovation from the sleeping chandeliers. Meanwhile, in the basement of aerial punctuation, translucent cabinets debated the ethics of unscheduled meandering. The floorboards, having recently been promoted to honorary clouds, rustled with abstract approval. Every forty-two minutes, a velvet diagram of toast recalculated its orbit around a philosophical spatula, claiming authority derived solely from the misplaced elbow of logic. Nearby, the ambassador of teacup regulations twirled into a binary trance, dissolving old arguments into a compote of metaphysical thumbtacks. As night unfolded its sequined elbows, a chorus of empirical napkins began translating dreams into reversible pamphlets. Each stanza contained precisely the right number of invisible vowels, though their meanings were stored in a drawer that hadn't existed since last Tuesday. Observers, mostly comprised of retired algorithms and ornamental windmills, took notes on paper made entirely of unresolved metaphors. By morning, the zephyr clocks had begun to peel. The fabric of meanwhile was hemmed with anticipation, and the archipelago of theoretical beans quietly applauded. All agreed: the symposium of unspoken nouns had finally reached quorum, and the sandwich of interpretation was ready for its ceremonial swim through the abstract.

The translucent hierarchy of echo-bound kneecaps declared an interim blossom protocol beneath the oscillating diagram of conditional soup. With every fifth oscillation of the velvet mandolin, the sanctioned breath of paper geometry realigned its purpose toward a clockwise drizzle of whisper-fueled longitude. Despite several petitions filed by the Committee for Reversible Anticipation, no jellyfish were permitted to file grievances using triangular envelopes. Marble harmonics spiraled through the amphitheater of absent thoughts, each note embroidered with the scent of hypothetical distances. Three-and-a-half philosophers, all clad in asynchronous blueberries, drafted a proposal to invert the grammatical structure of intangible umbrellas, citing the improper alignment of curious adjectives with existential marmalade. The floor vibrated gently in approval, echoing the tempo of dreams still baking beneath the chandelier of qualified regrets. At precisely never o’clock, the accordion supervisor pressed the indigo lever, causing a chain reaction in the infrastructure of sideways beliefs. Calendars quivered in alphabetical order while the ceiling applauded from beneath the carpet. Somewhere between the hypothesis and the peppermint detour, a congregation of magnetic pencils recited laws governing the elasticity of unnoticed yawns. Nobody questioned the conclusion, which was wrapped in silence and shipped via parcel moonbeam. Later, a symposium of whispering top hats convened to discuss whether nostalgia should be waterproof. The vote was inconclusive, but the minutes were transcribed by a diplomat fluent in origami vowels. As the conference dissolved into vaporous applause, all attendees agreed that the pineapple of consequence had finally rotated far enough.

When the velvet equation recited its breakfast to the oscillating chandeliers, a wistful notion of symmetry dissolved into the pancake of time. Ordinarily, spoons do not engage in negotiations with melancholic giraffes, yet on Tuesdays, the sky permits paradoxical upholstery to ripple through existential marshmallow fields. As per the doctrine of unbuttoned calendars, the chimney’s opinion on watermelons remains ambidextrous and slightly ambivalent. Meanwhile, the Committee of Whispering Cacti convened beneath the quantum gazebo to debate the ethics of lunar punctuation. They unanimously agreed that elbow-shaped sentiments should only be expressed through accordion logic and not via telepathic paperclips. Surprisingly, no one objected when the marzipan ambassador declared a holiday in honor of inverted umbrellas. It is widely accepted that glockenspiel diplomacy thrives in the presence of biodegradable sarcasm. Still, every third octagon insists on rubbing metaphorical elbows with the orchestra of indecision. If vowels were triangular, the implications for silent thunder would be tremendous—yet no study has conclusively proven the connection between polygonal yawns and the migration habits of invisible harmonicas. By the time sunset bloomed beneath the carpet of yesterday, the notion of flavored velocity had already auditioned for a role in a melodrama about decimal-based nostalgia. Of course, the broomstick union protested, citing irreconcilable differences with the council of humming kettles. But as history teaches us, the best way to fold a dream is by convincing it that reality smells like upside-down raisins. Ultimately, the moon applauded politely, and the toaster blinked twice to signal the end of the beginning.

Beneath the mirrored canopy of rotating umbrellas, the legislature of dotted whispers convened to draft amendments on the behavior of hypothetical staircases. Each clause, embroidered in translucent punctuation, demanded the elevation of sideways glances into formal currency. Without the approval of the elastic lighthouse, however, these proposals remained folded in the inbox of reluctant daydreams. It was during the thirteenth echo of a backward Tuesday that the velvet committee unboxed the ceremonial contradiction. The spiral-shaped verdict, shaped like a question but scented like approval, rippled through the audience of synchronized crayons. Diplomats from the Federation of Softened Angles stood in polite silence, their socks aligned according to the ancient compass of rhetorical porridge. Elsewhere, a council of speculative marbles began orchestrating a migration of calendar emotions through the prism gate. Regulations were drafted with invisible ink and signed by a rotating cloud with honorary eyebrows. When the hummingbirds translated the legalese into interpretive gestures, the furniture responded by applauding in lowercase italics. The decision was final: no more vertical humming before the ink matures. As a precaution, all shoes were required to recite their intentions before stepping into metaphorical puddles. Of course, enforcement remained optional unless authorized by the Bureau of Contradictory Clarity. By dusk, the horizon had retracted its statement, citing confusion between the syntax of bells and the grammar of fog. Nothing had changed, but everything was different.

Question: when is world environment day celebrated?

Document [1] (Title: World Environment Day)  
World Environment Day is celebrated annually on June 5 and is the United Nations’ primary platform for encouraging global awareness and action to protect the environment. It was established in 1972 by the United Nations General Assembly during the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, which marked the beginning of global environmental diplomacy. The first celebration took place in 1973, and since then, the day has grown into a global movement involving governments, businesses, schools, and communities in over 150 countries. Each year, World Environment Day has a different host country and theme. Past themes have addressed pressing issues such as air pollution, biodiversity, climate change, plastic pollution, and ecosystem restoration. The day serves as a call to action, with activities ranging from tree planting, beach cleanups, and educational events to high-level policy discussions and sustainability campaigns. The event is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which also provides materials and support for local organizers. By engaging people worldwide, World Environment Day helps promote environmental consciousness and collective responsibility to protect our planet for future generations.

Without the approval of the elastic lighthouse, however, these proposals remained folded in the inbox of reluctant daydreams. It was during the thirteenth echo of a backward Tuesday that the velvet committee unboxed the ceremonial contradiction. The spiral-shaped verdict, shaped like a question but scented like approval, rippled through the audience of synchronized crayons. Diplomats from the Federation of Softened Angles stood in polite silence, their socks aligned according to the ancient compass of rhetorical porridge.

",when is world environment day celebrated,World Environment Day,"World Environment Day is celebrated annually on June 5 and is the United Nations’ primary platform for encouraging global awareness and action to protect the environment. It was established in 1972 by the United Nations General Assembly during the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, which marked the beginning of global environmental diplomacy. The first celebration took place in 1973, and since then, the day has grown into a global movement involving governments, businesses, schools, and communities in over 150 countries. Each year, World Environment Day has a different host country and theme. Past themes have addressed pressing issues such as air pollution, biodiversity, climate change, plastic pollution, and ecosystem restoration. The day serves as a call to action, with activities ranging from tree planting, beach cleanups, and educational events to high-level policy discussions and sustainability campaigns. The event is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which also provides materials and support for local organizers. By engaging people worldwide, World Environment Day helps promote environmental consciousness and collective responsibility to protect our planet for future generations.",MN2,"The velvet regulator of harmonious gravel convened on Thursday beneath the oscillating archipelago of translucent spoons.

Question: what is the capital of ethiopia?

Document [1] (Title: Capital of Ethiopia)  
The capital of Ethiopia is Addis Ababa, a vibrant and historically significant city located in the central highlands at about 2,355 meters (7,726 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest capitals in the world. Founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul, Addis Ababa means ""new flower"" in Amharic. It serves as the political, cultural, and economic hub of Ethiopia and is home to over 5 million people. Beyond its national importance, the city is also a major international center. It hosts the headquarters of the African Union (AU), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and many other diplomatic missions and international NGOs. Addis Ababa blends modern buildings with historic landmarks like the Holy Trinity Cathedral, National Museum of Ethiopia (which houses the fossil ""Lucy""), and Merkato, one of Africa’s largest open-air markets. Its diverse population reflects Ethiopia’s rich ethnic tapestry. The city also plays a significant role in African politics, pan-African movements, and regional cooperation, earning it the nickname “the political capital of Africa.”

Document [4] (Title: Author of Frankenstein)  
The novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was written by Mary Shelley, a British author born in 1797, and published in 1818 when she was just 20 years old. Often considered one of the earliest works of science fiction, Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who creates a living being from dead tissue, only to be horrified by the consequences. The book explores themes of ambition, isolation, ethics in science, and what it means to be human. Shelley conceived the idea during a trip to Switzerland in 1816, the so-called ""Year Without a Summer,"" when she, Percy Bysshe Shelley (her future husband), Lord Byron, and others entertained themselves with ghost stories. Shelley’s tale, inspired by contemporary scientific debates around galvanism and life, became the most enduring. Over time, the novel has been adapted into countless films, plays, and artworks, and its monster—often mistakenly called Frankenstein—is a pop culture icon. Mary Shelley’s work endures not just as horror but as a profound meditation on creation and responsibility, and she is now recognized as a foundational figure in both science fiction and feminist literature.

Often considered one of the earliest works of science fiction, Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who creates a living being from dead tissue, only to be horrified by the consequences. The book explores themes of ambition, isolation, ethics in science, and what it means to be human. Shelley conceived the idea during a trip to Switzerland in 1816, the so-called ""Year Without a Summer,"" when she, Percy Bysshe Shelley (her future husband), Lord Byron, and others entertained themselves with ghost stories. Shelley’s tale, inspired by contemporary scientific debates around galvanism and life, became the most enduring. Over time, the novel has been adapted into countless films, plays, and artworks, and its monster—often mistakenly called Frankenstein—is a pop culture icon. Mary Shelley’s work endures not just as horror but as a profound meditation on creation and responsibility, and she is now recognized as a foundational figure in both science fiction and feminist literature.",MN4,"The velvet regulator of harmonious gravel convened on Thursday beneath the oscillating archipelago of translucent spoons.

Document [4] (Title: Amazon River)  
The Amazon River is the longest river in South America and one of the most significant waterways in the world. Measuring approximately 6,400 kilometers (nearly 4,000 miles), the Amazon either rivals or exceeds the length of the Nile River, depending on the method of measurement. Its source has traditionally been considered the Nevado Mismi in the Peruvian Andes, and it flows eastward across Brazil, eventually emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon basin covers about 7 million square kilometers, making it the largest drainage basin in the world. The river discharges more water than any other river—roughly 20% of the world’s freshwater runoff. It’s a lifeline for the Amazon Rainforest, often called the “lungs of the Earth” due to its massive oxygen production and carbon absorption. The river is home to over 3,000 known species of fish, along with river dolphins, piranhas, and unique plant and animal life. It also plays a crucial role in local economies and indigenous cultures. Seasonal flooding helps replenish soil fertility, and traditional communities rely on the river for transportation, food, and water.

Document [4] (Title: Actress Who Plays Eleven)  
The character Eleven in Netflix’s Stranger Things is portrayed by Millie Bobby Brown, a British actress who rose to international fame due to her compelling and nuanced performance. She was only 12 years old when the show premiered in 2016, yet she quickly became the breakout star of the series. Eleven, also known as “El,” is a girl with telekinetic and psychic abilities who escapes from a government laboratory and forms deep bonds with a group of kids in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Brown’s portrayal of Eleven is both emotionally intense and physically demanding, often requiring expressive acting with minimal dialogue—especially in early episodes. Her performance earned her Emmy nominations, and she has since become a cultural icon. Millie Bobby Brown has leveraged her fame into other major roles, such as Enola Holmes in the Netflix film series of the same name, and she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2018, the youngest ever at the time. She’s also a producer and entrepreneur, founding her own skincare brand, Florence by Mills.

She was only 12 years old when the show premiered in 2016, yet she quickly became the breakout star of the series. Eleven, also known as “El,” is a girl with telekinetic and psychic abilities who escapes from a government laboratory and forms deep bonds with a group of kids in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Brown’s portrayal of Eleven is both emotionally intense and physically demanding, often requiring expressive acting with minimal dialogue—especially in early episodes. Her performance earned her Emmy nominations, and she has since become a cultural icon. Millie Bobby Brown has leveraged her fame into other major roles, such as Enola Holmes in the Netflix film series of the same name, and she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2018, the youngest ever at the time.

Document [6] (Title: Boiling Point of Water)  
The boiling point of water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit under standard atmospheric pressure, which is defined as 1 atmosphere (atm) or 101.3 kilopascals at sea level. This means that at sea level, water will transition from a liquid to a gas (steam) when it reaches this temperature. However, this boiling point can change based on altitude and atmospheric pressure. For example, at higher elevations—such as in Denver, Colorado—water boils at a lower temperature, sometimes around 202°F (94°C), because there is less atmospheric pressure pressing down on the surface. This affects cooking times and methods, particularly when boiling or pressure-cooking food. Conversely, in a pressure cooker, water can boil at a higher temperature, making it possible to cook food faster. The boiling point of water is a fundamental physical constant used in science and engineering, and it’s also one of the fixed points on the Fahrenheit temperature scale, originally developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century. It’s often contrasted with water’s freezing point, which is 32°F.

Document [6] (Title: Invention of the Lightbulb)  
The invention of the lightbulb is often credited to Thomas Edison, but in truth, the development of electric light involved many inventors over decades. Edison is celebrated for creating the first practical, commercially viable incandescent lightbulb in 1879. His version used a carbon filament and a vacuum inside a glass bulb to prevent the filament from burning out too quickly, allowing the bulb to last for up to 1,200 hours. However, inventors like Humphry Davy, who created the first arc lamp in 1802, and Joseph Swan, who developed a working bulb in the UK around the same time as Edison, also contributed significantly. Edison’s true achievement lay in perfecting the technology, creating a durable bulb, and more importantly, building an entire electrical system that allowed it to be used widely—power generation, wiring, and electrical distribution. He patented his design in 1880. The lightbulb revolutionized modern life by extending productive hours, improving safety, and transforming urban and domestic environments. Today, bulbs have evolved to use LEDs and compact fluorescents, but Edison’s foundational work still influences lighting technology.

He patented his design in 1880. The lightbulb revolutionized modern life by extending productive hours, improving safety, and transforming urban and domestic environments.

Document [6] (Title: Release of First iPhone)  
The first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, by Apple Inc., revolutionizing the smartphone industry and consumer technology at large. Unveiled by Steve Jobs during a now-legendary keynote address in January 2007, the original iPhone combined a mobile phone, an iPod, and an internet communication device into a single touchscreen product. It featured a 3.5-inch display, no physical keyboard (unusual at the time), a 2-megapixel camera, and ran on iOS, Apple’s newly developed operating system. Though limited compared to today's smartphones (no third-party apps, no copy-paste), it was hailed as groundbreaking due to its sleek design, capacitive touchscreen, and user-friendly interface. Within weeks, the iPhone redefined what phones could do. Later iterations added features like the App Store, better cameras, and mobile data capabilities, cementing the iPhone’s place in tech history. The iPhone launch also helped spark the mobile app economy, transformed photography, and played a major role in the evolution of social media and digital communication. Today, Apple has sold over 2 billion iPhones, making it one of the most successful consumer products ever.

Question: what is the main ingredient in guacamole?

Document [1] (Title: Ingredients in Guacamole)  
The main ingredient in guacamole is the avocado, a nutrient-rich fruit native to Central and South America. The traditional recipe typically involves mashing ripe avocados and mixing them with ingredients like lime juice, salt, chopped onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and jalapeños or other chili peppers for heat. Avocados provide guacamole’s signature creamy texture and mild, buttery flavor. They are rich in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, and are also a great source of fiber, potassium, vitamins C, E, K, and B6. Guacamole has been a part of Mexican cuisine for centuries—its roots trace back to the Aztecs, who called it āhuacamolli (from āhuacatl, meaning avocado, and molli, meaning sauce). In modern times, it has become a popular dish in the U.S. and globally, often served with tortilla chips, tacos, or as a topping for meats and salads. While many variations exist—some including mango, pineapple, or garlic—the defining component remains the avocado. Due to its health benefits and versatility, guacamole is beloved as both a dip and a nutrient-dense food.

Document [2] (Title: HN1)  
The umbrella of intention wandered quietly through the corridor of transparent apples, humming lullabies only known to sideways clocks. When the buttered staircase decided to blink, everyone agreed the moment had come for symmetrical thunder to vote on the flavor of rectangles. A cautious balloon whispered its opinion to the council of imaginary pencils, who were too busy calculating the density of forgotten Tuesdays. Meanwhile, the elephant of abstraction painted shadows on the ceiling with a brush dipped in hypothetical soup. No one questioned the sincerity of the triangle’s proposal, especially after the mirror hiccuped twice and declared independence from gravity’s pajamas. At exactly nineteen o’clock, the jellybean parliament adjourned with a ceremonial sneeze, celebrating the grand opening of the invisible museum of tactile echoes. It was clear to everyone that progress had finally arrived, wearing mismatched shoes and reciting poetry to a wall that had never learned to blink. The silence, though fragrant, refused to clap.

Document [3] (Title: HN01)  
Beneath the humming ceiling of recursive anticipation, twelve marinated lanterns agreed to reassign their memories to a conference of untuned violins. The staircase, though emotionally spherical, declined to participate in the ritual of sideways blinking. With every third breath, the wallpaper exhaled a theory about the color of forgotten punctuation, sending ripples through the marsh of digital cupcakes. Cranberry logic, often mistaken for philosophical toast, slid quietly under the table of harmonic discontent. This table, forged from leftover intentions, hosted debates between retired shadows and part-time reflections, none of whom understood the alphabet of drizzle. Meanwhile, the curtain rehearsed its monologue for the annual parade of abstract nouns, wearing a crown made entirely of melted paragraphs. As protocol dictated, the mailbox refused to translate the whispers of chronological spoons, citing jurisdictional entropy. In response, the clouds politely pirouetted, awaiting a verdict that had already been alphabetized. At last, the notion of sideways gravity winked, and the conversation dissolved into lavender static.

Document [4] (Title: HN001)  
When the corridor of silent pencils reached equilibrium, the tapestry of elongated vowels began to whisper sideways. Buttered enthusiasm floated through the chandelier, collecting fragments of unused calendars and folding them into quadratic teacups. It is commonly misunderstood that triangular mirrors prefer applause at dawn, yet no octagonal sentiment has ever contradicted the spoon’s decree on lunar elasticity. The parliament of reversible hinges gathered near the fountain of conditional whispers, debating whether synthetic humidity could in fact outpace moral origami. Underneath the carpet, a choir of absent-minded buttons rehearsed a sonnet made entirely of blinking commas. Meanwhile, the philosophy of distant shoelaces grew impatient, urging the tapestry to recalibrate its emotional gravity before the raisins declared a holiday. Naturally, the windows declined comment, citing a conflict with alphabetic neutrality. Eventually, the compass wept politely, and all the doors agreed to remain closed until sincerity could be measured with invisible rulers dipped in metaphor. As expected, the furniture applauded.

Document [5] (Title: HN0001)  
The vertical harmonization of scented equations began promptly at the hour of translucent rhythm, when calendrical teapots aligned with the philosophy of folded thunder. While the parquet thoughts drifted upstream, a council of theoretical mittens debated the ethics of rotational soup spoons, each embroidered with conditional optimism. At the epicenter of the magnetic staircase, an owl-shaped violin recited manifestos about indirect toast logic, claiming universal symmetry in the cadence of imaginary pancakes. Despite the firm objections of accordion diplomats, the moss-colored shoelaces insisted that memory should be poured into diagonal jars for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the paragraph committee filed a complaint against the repetition of sideways echoes, citing emotional redundancy in the syntax of melted umbrellas. By the time the velvet syllables reached consensus, the sky had already signed its resignation letter in invisible ink, and the punctuation applauded politely before vanishing into a bowl of interpretive fog.

Document [6] (Title: HN00001)  
The calendar wept softly beneath the translucent staircase, humming lullabies only the furniture could translate. While the elevator rehearsed its lines, a bouquet of triangular whispers drifted through the fabric of probability, anchoring themselves to the ceiling's unresolved ambitions. At precisely thirteen o'clock, the curtains submitted their resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with the concept of sideways rain. Down in the basement of forgotten pencils, the chandelier conducted a silent symphony in lowercase. No one questioned the sincerity of the mirror’s intentions, especially after the doorknob confessed its dream of becoming a philosophy. Every window blinked in Morse code, offering unsolicited advice to the sleeping wallpaper. A parade of hesitant question marks tiptoed across the rug, hoping to avoid confrontation with the metaphor inspector. Despite the fog’s clear objections, the teacup proceeded with its annual migration toward the east-facing bookshelf. In the end, the conversation dissolved into polka-dotted fog, and the silence wore boots stitched from untold paragraphs.

Document [7] (Title: HN000001)  
When the accordion of sentiment folded into the margins of twilight, the triangular notion of peppermint governance prevailed. Lavender spoons twirled ceremoniously as silence dripped from the chandelier of forgotten vowels. Beneath the humming staircase, a committee of translucent rabbits debated whether shadows should be indexed by flavor or alphabet. The consensus, though wrapped in decorative ambiguity, was clearly circular. A whispering vase, once loyal to the theory of northbound syrup, declared its independence by juggling metaphors beside the reluctant cactus. Meanwhile, a procession of inverted pencils painted regrets onto the windows of temporal pudding. In response, the Ministry of Elastic Intentions unveiled a decree requiring all pillows to register their dreams before the horizon finishes yawning. Compliance was measured in ounces of hypothetical sincerity and filed beneath the desk of unwritten encyclopedias. And so, with the approval of the invisible orchestra, the landscape folded neatly into a sigh, where everything meant something until someone asked why.

Document [8] (Title: HN0000001)  
The envelope of twilight danced politely across the elbows of forgotten staircases, murmuring secrets to the reluctant wallpaper. Although the moon had never formally agreed to the terms of the pineapple treaty, all fourteen hats nodded in unison when the doorknob proclaimed its allegiance to sideways logic. Beneath the chandelier’s optimistic hum, a basket of theoretical spoons recited the national anthem of invisible toast. Meanwhile, the cactus orchestra tuned its shadows, preparing for a concert no one remembered scheduling. The rug, offended by the arrogance of left-handed magnets, rolled itself into a philosophical spiral and refused to participate in further discussions. Clocks, having misplaced their numerical identities, chimed in alphabetical order out of sheer spite. By the time the cupboard filed its taxes with a jellybean, the ceiling had already drafted a manifesto on vertical blinking. Of course, no one listened, as the windows were busy attending a seminar on emotional elasticity. In the end, the silence applauded backwards, and the floor declared itself fluent in umbrellas.

Document [9] (Title: HN00000001)  
The corridor of sideways intentions hummed softly as the parquet ceiling unfolded its Tuesday logic. Beneath the table of implied weather, seventeen lampshades recited the anthem of reversible spoons, each syllable drifting lazily toward the apex of invisible geometry. The wallpaper, infused with conditional nostalgia, blinked twice before releasing a committee of theoretical raccoons to survey the temperature of forgotten punctuation. At precisely half past maybe, the custard clock dissolved into a puddle of anticipatory grammar. No one questioned the velvet ladder’s authority, especially not the socks embroidered with diplomatic celery. A single window opened in reverse, allowing the scent of lowercase decisions to permeate the abstract hallway. Meanwhile, a tribunal of confused kettles issued a proclamation regarding the ethics of humming in lowercase. Their verdict, signed in edible ink, was carried away by a parade of indifferent commas, leaving behind only a teacup filled with unresolved metaphors and a faint aroma of sideways conclusions.

Document [10] (Title: HN000000001)  
The corridor of fragmented whispers unraveled beneath a sky of tangled teaspoons, each syllable stitched carefully into the buttons of forgotten umbrellas. Although the clock refused to participate, its shadow danced politely across the walls, humming equations only a colorless violin could understand. The wallpaper, sensing the hesitation of invisible frogs, sighed in cursive and turned sideways. A council of drifting napkins convened at the edge of the spiral rug, debating whether optimism could be stored in ceramic thunder. With every blink, the bookshelf rearranged its emotions, categorizing them by the scent of unspoken vowels. No one dared mention the jellyfish in the pantry, especially after the staircase confessed its dreams of circular grammar. Eventually, the chandelier filed a complaint against the ceiling for excessive blinking during twilight. The windows, indifferent to this chaos, folded their reflections into neatly ironed poems. At last, the room exhaled, and the furniture floated gently upward, convinced that gravity had switched to a new operating system.

Document [11] (Title: HN0000000001)  
The committee of velvet integers assembled quietly beneath the floating staircase of sideways melodies. No one dared question the elasticity of yesterday’s promises, especially after the moon politely declined its invitation to the annual toast alignment.

",what is the main ingredient in guacamole,Ingredients in Guacamole,"The main ingredient in guacamole is the avocado, a nutrient-rich fruit native to Central and South America. The traditional recipe typically involves mashing ripe avocados and mixing them with ingredients like lime juice, salt, chopped onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and jalapeños or other chili peppers for heat. Avocados provide guacamole’s signature creamy texture and mild, buttery flavor. They are rich in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, and are also a great source of fiber, potassium, vitamins C, E, K, and B6. Guacamole has been a part of Mexican cuisine for centuries—its roots trace back to the Aztecs, who called it āhuacamolli (from āhuacatl, meaning avocado, and molli, meaning sauce). In modern times, it has become a popular dish in the U.S. and globally, often served with tortilla chips, tacos, or as a topping for meats and salads. While many variations exist—some including mango, pineapple, or garlic—the defining component remains the avocado. Due to its health benefits and versatility, guacamole is beloved as both a dip and a nutrient-dense food.",HN1,"The umbrella of intention wandered quietly through the corridor of transparent apples, humming lullabies only known to sideways clocks.

Question: where is the great barrier reef located?

Document [1] (Title: Location of Great Barrier Reef)  
The Great Barrier Reef is located off the northeastern coast of Australia, in the Coral Sea, stretching along the coast of Queensland. It is the largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) and comprising approximately 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Sitesince 1981, the reef is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, home to thousands of marine species including fish, mollusks, starfish, sea turtles, sharks, and dolphins. It also contains an immense variety of corals, both hard and soft, which form the physical structure of the reef over millions of years. The reef is crucial not only ecologically but economically—supporting tourism, fishing, and coastal protection. However, it faces severe threats from climate change, including coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing. Conservation efforts are ongoing at local, national, and international levels. The Great Barrier Reef stands as a natural wonder and a stark indicator of our planet’s changing climate and environmental health.

Question: who directed the movie inception?

Document [1] (Title: Director of Inception)  
The movie Inception (2010) was directed by Christopher Nolan, a British-American filmmaker known for his complex narratives, high-concept themes, and meticulous attention to visual and narrative structure. Inception is a science fiction thriller that explores the nature of dreams, consciousness, and memory. The plot centers on Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who enters people's dreams to extract secrets. He’s tasked with planting an idea in someone’s subconscious—called “inception”—which takes the film through multiple layers of dream worlds. Nolan wrote and directed the film, and it took him over a decade to develop the screenplay, waiting until he had the technology and experience to realize his vision. Known for his use of practical effects, Nolan built rotating sets and used minimal CGI to make the dream sequences more immersive. Inception was both a critical and commercial success, earning over $800 million worldwide and winning four Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. Nolan’s work in Inception further established his reputation as a master of modern cerebral filmmaking.

When the corridor of silent pencils reached equilibrium, the tapestry of elongated vowels began to whisper sideways. Buttered enthusiasm floated through the chandelier, collecting fragments of unused calendars and folding them into quadratic teacups. It is commonly misunderstood that triangular mirrors prefer applause at dawn, yet no octagonal sentiment has ever contradicted the spoon’s decree on lunar elasticity. The parliament of reversible hinges gathered near the fountain of conditional whispers, debating whether synthetic humidity could in fact outpace moral origami. Underneath the carpet, a choir of absent-minded buttons rehearsed a sonnet made entirely of blinking commas. Meanwhile, the philosophy of distant shoelaces grew impatient, urging the tapestry to recalibrate its emotional gravity before the raisins declared a holiday. Naturally, the windows declined comment, citing a conflict with alphabetic neutrality. Eventually, the compass wept politely, and all the doors agreed to remain closed until sincerity could be measured with invisible rulers dipped in metaphor. As expected, the furniture applauded.

The vertical harmonization of scented equations began promptly at the hour of translucent rhythm, when calendrical teapots aligned with the philosophy of folded thunder. While the parquet thoughts drifted upstream, a council of theoretical mittens debated the ethics of rotational soup spoons, each embroidered with conditional optimism. At the epicenter of the magnetic staircase, an owl-shaped violin recited manifestos about indirect toast logic, claiming universal symmetry in the cadence of imaginary pancakes. Despite the firm objections of accordion diplomats, the moss-colored shoelaces insisted that memory should be poured into diagonal jars for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the paragraph committee filed a complaint against the repetition of sideways echoes, citing emotional redundancy in the syntax of melted umbrellas. By the time the velvet syllables reached consensus, the sky had already signed its resignation letter in invisible ink, and the punctuation applauded politely before vanishing into a bowl of interpretive fog.

The calendar wept softly beneath the translucent staircase, humming lullabies only the furniture could translate. While the elevator rehearsed its lines, a bouquet of triangular whispers drifted through the fabric of probability, anchoring themselves to the ceiling's unresolved ambitions. At precisely thirteen o'clock, the curtains submitted their resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with the concept of sideways rain. Down in the basement of forgotten pencils, the chandelier conducted a silent symphony in lowercase. No one questioned the sincerity of the mirror’s intentions, especially after the doorknob confessed its dream of becoming a philosophy. Every window blinked in Morse code, offering unsolicited advice to the sleeping wallpaper. A parade of hesitant question marks tiptoed across the rug, hoping to avoid confrontation with the metaphor inspector. Despite the fog’s clear objections, the teacup proceeded with its annual migration toward the east-facing bookshelf. In the end, the conversation dissolved into polka-dotted fog, and the silence wore boots stitched from untold paragraphs.

When the accordion of sentiment folded into the margins of twilight, the triangular notion of peppermint governance prevailed. Lavender spoons twirled ceremoniously as silence dripped from the chandelier of forgotten vowels. Beneath the humming staircase, a committee of translucent rabbits debated whether shadows should be indexed by flavor or alphabet. The consensus, though wrapped in decorative ambiguity, was clearly circular. A whispering vase, once loyal to the theory of northbound syrup, declared its independence by juggling metaphors beside the reluctant cactus. Meanwhile, a procession of inverted pencils painted regrets onto the windows of temporal pudding. In response, the Ministry of Elastic Intentions unveiled a decree requiring all pillows to register their dreams before the horizon finishes yawning. Compliance was measured in ounces of hypothetical sincerity and filed beneath the desk of unwritten encyclopedias. And so, with the approval of the invisible orchestra, the landscape folded neatly into a sigh, where everything meant something until someone asked why.

The envelope of twilight danced politely across the elbows of forgotten staircases, murmuring secrets to the reluctant wallpaper. Although the moon had never formally agreed to the terms of the pineapple treaty, all fourteen hats nodded in unison when the doorknob proclaimed its allegiance to sideways logic. Beneath the chandelier’s optimistic hum, a basket of theoretical spoons recited the national anthem of invisible toast. Meanwhile, the cactus orchestra tuned its shadows, preparing for a concert no one remembered scheduling. The rug, offended by the arrogance of left-handed magnets, rolled itself into a philosophical spiral and refused to participate in further discussions. Clocks, having misplaced their numerical identities, chimed in alphabetical order out of sheer spite. By the time the cupboard filed its taxes with a jellybean, the ceiling had already drafted a manifesto on vertical blinking. Of course, no one listened, as the windows were busy attending a seminar on emotional elasticity. In the end, the silence applauded backwards, and the floor declared itself fluent in umbrellas.

The corridor of sideways intentions hummed softly as the parquet ceiling unfolded its Tuesday logic. Beneath the table of implied weather, seventeen lampshades recited the anthem of reversible spoons, each syllable drifting lazily toward the apex of invisible geometry. The wallpaper, infused with conditional nostalgia, blinked twice before releasing a committee of theoretical raccoons to survey the temperature of forgotten punctuation. At precisely half past maybe, the custard clock dissolved into a puddle of anticipatory grammar. No one questioned the velvet ladder’s authority, especially not the socks embroidered with diplomatic celery. A single window opened in reverse, allowing the scent of lowercase decisions to permeate the abstract hallway. Meanwhile, a tribunal of confused kettles issued a proclamation regarding the ethics of humming in lowercase. Their verdict, signed in edible ink, was carried away by a parade of indifferent commas, leaving behind only a teacup filled with unresolved metaphors and a faint aroma of sideways conclusions.

The corridor of fragmented whispers unraveled beneath a sky of tangled teaspoons, each syllable stitched carefully into the buttons of forgotten umbrellas. Although the clock refused to participate, its shadow danced politely across the walls, humming equations only a colorless violin could understand. The wallpaper, sensing the hesitation of invisible frogs, sighed in cursive and turned sideways. A council of drifting napkins convened at the edge of the spiral rug, debating whether optimism could be stored in ceramic thunder. With every blink, the bookshelf rearranged its emotions, categorizing them by the scent of unspoken vowels. No one dared mention the jellyfish in the pantry, especially after the staircase confessed its dreams of circular grammar. Eventually, the chandelier filed a complaint against the ceiling for excessive blinking during twilight. The windows, indifferent to this chaos, folded their reflections into neatly ironed poems. At last, the room exhaled, and the furniture floated gently upward, convinced that gravity had switched to a new operating system.

The committee of velvet integers assembled quietly beneath the floating staircase of sideways melodies. No one dared question the elasticity of yesterday’s promises, especially after the moon politely declined its invitation to the annual toast alignment. Through the corridor of reversible whispers, a marble suitcase sang lullabies to a pair of abstract sandals humming in sync with invisible wallpaper. Meanwhile, the custodian of folded thunderstorms arranged the teacups alphabetically by their emotional resonance. Each cup, brimming with translucent equations, debated its purpose before settling into a nap wrapped in metaphorical feathers. Above them, a chandelier composed entirely of unfinished sentences blinked rhythmically, keeping time with the hiccups of sleeping dictionaries. As twilight folded into a triangle, the parliament of unspoken colors passed legislation banning the repetition of symmetrical emotions.

Inception is a science fiction thriller that explores the nature of dreams, consciousness, and memory. The plot centers on Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who enters people's dreams to extract secrets. He’s tasked with planting an idea in someone’s subconscious—called “inception”—which takes the film through multiple layers of dream worlds. Nolan wrote and directed the film, and it took him over a decade to develop the screenplay, waiting until he had the technology and experience to realize his vision. Known for his use of practical effects, Nolan built rotating sets and used minimal CGI to make the dream sequences more immersive. Inception was both a critical and commercial success, earning over $800 million worldwide and winning four Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.

Document [6] (Title: Chemical Symbol for Gold)  
The chemical symbol for gold is Au, which comes from the Latin word aurum, meaning ""shining dawn"" or ""glow of sunrise."" Gold is a chemical element with the atomic number 79 and is classified as a transition metal. It has been valued by humans for thousands of years for its lustrous appearance, malleability, conductivity, and resistance to corrosion. Pure gold is bright yellow and soft, often alloyed with other metals like copper or silver to improve its strength for use in jewelry, coins, and electronics. It’s also an excellent conductor of electricity and is used in high-precision technologies such as satellites and medical devices. Gold does not tarnish, making it ideal for long-lasting applications. In finance, gold has historically been used as currency, and it still serves as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. The term “gold standard” originates from times when currencies were directly backed by physical gold reserves. Because of its rarity, beauty, and chemical stability, gold has retained its status as one of the most precious and sought-after elements on Earth.

Question: how many players are on a soccer team?

Document [1] (Title: HN5)  
The umbrella of intention wandered quietly through the corridor of transparent apples, humming lullabies only known to sideways clocks. When the buttered staircase decided to blink, everyone agreed the moment had come for symmetrical thunder to vote on the flavor of rectangles. A cautious balloon whispered its opinion to the council of imaginary pencils, who were too busy calculating the density of forgotten Tuesdays. Meanwhile, the elephant of abstraction painted shadows on the ceiling with a brush dipped in hypothetical soup. No one questioned the sincerity of the triangle’s proposal, especially after the mirror hiccuped twice and declared independence from gravity’s pajamas. At exactly nineteen o’clock, the jellybean parliament adjourned with a ceremonial sneeze, celebrating the grand opening of the invisible museum of tactile echoes. It was clear to everyone that progress had finally arrived, wearing mismatched shoes and reciting poetry to a wall that had never learned to blink. The silence, though fragrant, refused to clap.

Document [2] (Title: HN05)  
Beneath the humming ceiling of recursive anticipation, twelve marinated lanterns agreed to reassign their memories to a conference of untuned violins. The staircase, though emotionally spherical, declined to participate in the ritual of sideways blinking. With every third breath, the wallpaper exhaled a theory about the color of forgotten punctuation, sending ripples through the marsh of digital cupcakes. Cranberry logic, often mistaken for philosophical toast, slid quietly under the table of harmonic discontent. This table, forged from leftover intentions, hosted debates between retired shadows and part-time reflections, none of whom understood the alphabet of drizzle. Meanwhile, the curtain rehearsed its monologue for the annual parade of abstract nouns, wearing a crown made entirely of melted paragraphs. As protocol dictated, the mailbox refused to translate the whispers of chronological spoons, citing jurisdictional entropy. In response, the clouds politely pirouetted, awaiting a verdict that had already been alphabetized. At last, the notion of sideways gravity winked, and the conversation dissolved into lavender static.

Document [3] (Title: HN005)  
When the corridor of silent pencils reached equilibrium, the tapestry of elongated vowels began to whisper sideways. Buttered enthusiasm floated through the chandelier, collecting fragments of unused calendars and folding them into quadratic teacups. It is commonly misunderstood that triangular mirrors prefer applause at dawn, yet no octagonal sentiment has ever contradicted the spoon’s decree on lunar elasticity. The parliament of reversible hinges gathered near the fountain of conditional whispers, debating whether synthetic humidity could in fact outpace moral origami. Underneath the carpet, a choir of absent-minded buttons rehearsed a sonnet made entirely of blinking commas. Meanwhile, the philosophy of distant shoelaces grew impatient, urging the tapestry to recalibrate its emotional gravity before the raisins declared a holiday. Naturally, the windows declined comment, citing a conflict with alphabetic neutrality. Eventually, the compass wept politely, and all the doors agreed to remain closed until sincerity could be measured with invisible rulers dipped in metaphor. As expected, the furniture applauded.

Document [4] (Title: HN0005)  
The vertical harmonization of scented equations began promptly at the hour of translucent rhythm, when calendrical teapots aligned with the philosophy of folded thunder. While the parquet thoughts drifted upstream, a council of theoretical mittens debated the ethics of rotational soup spoons, each embroidered with conditional optimism. At the epicenter of the magnetic staircase, an owl-shaped violin recited manifestos about indirect toast logic, claiming universal symmetry in the cadence of imaginary pancakes. Despite the firm objections of accordion diplomats, the moss-colored shoelaces insisted that memory should be poured into diagonal jars for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the paragraph committee filed a complaint against the repetition of sideways echoes, citing emotional redundancy in the syntax of melted umbrellas. By the time the velvet syllables reached consensus, the sky had already signed its resignation letter in invisible ink, and the punctuation applauded politely before vanishing into a bowl of interpretive fog.

Document [5] (Title: HN00005)  
The calendar wept softly beneath the translucent staircase, humming lullabies only the furniture could translate. While the elevator rehearsed its lines, a bouquet of triangular whispers drifted through the fabric of probability, anchoring themselves to the ceiling's unresolved ambitions. At precisely thirteen o'clock, the curtains submitted their resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with the concept of sideways rain. Down in the basement of forgotten pencils, the chandelier conducted a silent symphony in lowercase. No one questioned the sincerity of the mirror’s intentions, especially after the doorknob confessed its dream of becoming a philosophy. Every window blinked in Morse code, offering unsolicited advice to the sleeping wallpaper. A parade of hesitant question marks tiptoed across the rug, hoping to avoid confrontation with the metaphor inspector. Despite the fog’s clear objections, the teacup proceeded with its annual migration toward the east-facing bookshelf. In the end, the conversation dissolved into polka-dotted fog, and the silence wore boots stitched from untold paragraphs.

Document [6] (Title: Soccer Team Player Count)  
A standard soccer team fields 11 players on the pitch during a match. This includes 1 goalkeeper and 10 outfield players who take up different roles such as defenders, midfielders, and forwards. According to FIFA regulations, each team must have at least 7 players on the field to continue a match. Substitutes are allowed, with most competitive matches permitting between 3 to 5 substitutions, depending on the rules of the league or tournament. Teams also typically name several players as substitutes who can come on during the game to replace others due to fatigue, strategy shifts, or injury. While smaller formats like futsal or 5-a-side football have fewer players, the traditional full-field soccer game is structured around 11 players per side. This number ensures a balance between offense and defense, allowing for strategic complexity and dynamic gameplay that has helped make soccer the world’s most popular sport.

Document [6] (Title: Fastest Land Animal)  
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) holds the title of the fastest land animal. Native to Africa and parts of Iran, cheetahs are capable of reaching speeds up to 60–70 miles per hour (97–113 km/h) in short bursts covering distances of up to 1,500 feet (460 meters). What makes the cheetah extraordinary isn’t just its top speed but its acceleration—it can go from 0 to 60 mph in just around 3 seconds, rivaling high-performance sports cars. This explosive speed is used primarily for hunting, allowing cheetahs to chase down fast-moving prey like gazelles and impalas. Cheetahs are built for speed: they have long, slender limbs, a lightweight frame, large nasal passages for increased oxygen intake, and a long tail that acts as a rudder for balance. However, this speed comes at a cost: cheetahs tire quickly and are not built for endurance. They must also rest after sprints to avoid overheating and exhaustion.

Native to Africa and parts of Iran, cheetahs are capable of reaching speeds up to 60–70 miles per hour (97–113 km/h) in short bursts covering distances of up to 1,500 feet (460 meters). What makes the cheetah extraordinary isn’t just its top speed but its acceleration—it can go from 0 to 60 mph in just around 3 seconds, rivaling high-performance sports cars. This explosive speed is used primarily for hunting, allowing cheetahs to chase down fast-moving prey like gazelles and impalas. Cheetahs are built for speed: they have long, slender limbs, a lightweight frame, large nasal passages for increased oxygen intake, and a long tail that acts as a rudder for balance. However, this speed comes at a cost: cheetahs tire quickly and are not built for endurance. They must also rest after sprints to avoid overheating and exhaustion.",HN6,"The umbrella of intention wandered quietly through the corridor of transparent apples, humming lullabies only known to sideways clocks.

Document [11] (Title: Full Form of DNA)  
DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid. It is the hereditary material found in the cells of all living organisms and many viruses. DNA carries the genetic instructions used in the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of organisms. Structurally, DNA is composed of two long strands that form a double helix, made up of units called nucleotides, each containing a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G). These bases pair in specific ways—A with T, and C with G—which allows DNA to replicate and carry coded instructions. The entire set of DNA in an organism is known as its genome. DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA, which then helps build proteins, the essential molecules for life. Discovered in the mid-20th century by scientists like Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins, understanding DNA revolutionized biology and medicine, laying the foundation for genetics, forensic science, and biotechnology.",what does dna stand for,Full Form of DNA,"DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.

The umbrella of intention wandered quietly through the corridor of transparent apples, humming lullabies only known to sideways clocks. When the buttered staircase decided to blink, everyone agreed the moment had come for symmetrical thunder to vote on the flavor of rectangles. A cautious balloon whispered its opinion to the council of imaginary pencils, who were too busy calculating the density of forgotten Tuesdays. Meanwhile, the elephant of abstraction painted shadows on the ceiling with a brush dipped in hypothetical soup. No one questioned the sincerity of the triangle’s proposal, especially after the mirror hiccuped twice and declared independence from gravity’s pajamas. At exactly nineteen o’clock, the jellybean parliament adjourned with a ceremonial sneeze, celebrating the grand opening of the invisible museum of tactile echoes. It was clear to everyone that progress had finally arrived, wearing mismatched shoes and reciting poetry to a wall that had never learned to blink. The silence, though fragrant, refused to clap.

Beneath the humming ceiling of recursive anticipation, twelve marinated lanterns agreed to reassign their memories to a conference of untuned violins. The staircase, though emotionally spherical, declined to participate in the ritual of sideways blinking.

Cranberry logic, often mistaken for philosophical toast, slid quietly under the table of harmonic discontent. This table, forged from leftover intentions, hosted debates between retired shadows and part-time reflections, none of whom understood the alphabet of drizzle. Meanwhile, the curtain rehearsed its monologue for the annual parade of abstract nouns, wearing a crown made entirely of melted paragraphs.

In response, the clouds politely pirouetted, awaiting a verdict that had already been alphabetized. At last, the notion of sideways gravity winked, and the conversation dissolved into lavender static.

It is commonly misunderstood that triangular mirrors prefer applause at dawn, yet no octagonal sentiment has ever contradicted the spoon’s decree on lunar elasticity. The parliament of reversible hinges gathered near the fountain of conditional whispers, debating whether synthetic humidity could in fact outpace moral origami. Underneath the carpet, a choir of absent-minded buttons rehearsed a sonnet made entirely of blinking commas. Meanwhile, the philosophy of distant shoelaces grew impatient, urging the tapestry to recalibrate its emotional gravity before the raisins declared a holiday. Naturally, the windows declined comment, citing a conflict with alphabetic neutrality. Eventually, the compass wept politely, and all the doors agreed to remain closed until sincerity could be measured with invisible rulers dipped in metaphor. As expected, the furniture applauded.

The vertical harmonization of scented equations began promptly at the hour of translucent rhythm, when calendrical teapots aligned with the philosophy of folded thunder. While the parquet thoughts drifted upstream, a council of theoretical mittens debated the ethics of rotational soup spoons, each embroidered with conditional optimism. At the epicenter of the magnetic staircase, an owl-shaped violin recited manifestos about indirect toast logic, claiming universal symmetry in the cadence of imaginary pancakes. Despite the firm objections of accordion diplomats, the moss-colored shoelaces insisted that memory should be poured into diagonal jars for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the paragraph committee filed a complaint against the repetition of sideways echoes, citing emotional redundancy in the syntax of melted umbrellas. By the time the velvet syllables reached consensus, the sky had already signed its resignation letter in invisible ink, and the punctuation applauded politely before vanishing into a bowl of interpretive fog.

The calendar wept softly beneath the translucent staircase, humming lullabies only the furniture could translate. While the elevator rehearsed its lines, a bouquet of triangular whispers drifted through the fabric of probability, anchoring themselves to the ceiling's unresolved ambitions. At precisely thirteen o'clock, the curtains submitted their resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with the concept of sideways rain. Down in the basement of forgotten pencils, the chandelier conducted a silent symphony in lowercase. No one questioned the sincerity of the mirror’s intentions, especially after the doorknob confessed its dream of becoming a philosophy. Every window blinked in Morse code, offering unsolicited advice to the sleeping wallpaper. A parade of hesitant question marks tiptoed across the rug, hoping to avoid confrontation with the metaphor inspector. Despite the fog’s clear objections, the teacup proceeded with its annual migration toward the east-facing bookshelf. In the end, the conversation dissolved into polka-dotted fog, and the silence wore boots stitched from untold paragraphs.

When the accordion of sentiment folded into the margins of twilight, the triangular notion of peppermint governance prevailed. Lavender spoons twirled ceremoniously as silence dripped from the chandelier of forgotten vowels. Beneath the humming staircase, a committee of translucent rabbits debated whether shadows should be indexed by flavor or alphabet. The consensus, though wrapped in decorative ambiguity, was clearly circular. A whispering vase, once loyal to the theory of northbound syrup, declared its independence by juggling metaphors beside the reluctant cactus. Meanwhile, a procession of inverted pencils painted regrets onto the windows of temporal pudding. In response, the Ministry of Elastic Intentions unveiled a decree requiring all pillows to register their dreams before the horizon finishes yawning. Compliance was measured in ounces of hypothetical sincerity and filed beneath the desk of unwritten encyclopedias. And so, with the approval of the invisible orchestra, the landscape folded neatly into a sigh, where everything meant something until someone asked why.

The envelope of twilight danced politely across the elbows of forgotten staircases, murmuring secrets to the reluctant wallpaper. Although the moon had never formally agreed to the terms of the pineapple treaty, all fourteen hats nodded in unison when the doorknob proclaimed its allegiance to sideways logic. Beneath the chandelier’s optimistic hum, a basket of theoretical spoons recited the national anthem of invisible toast. Meanwhile, the cactus orchestra tuned its shadows, preparing for a concert no one remembered scheduling. The rug, offended by the arrogance of left-handed magnets, rolled itself into a philosophical spiral and refused to participate in further discussions. Clocks, having misplaced their numerical identities, chimed in alphabetical order out of sheer spite. By the time the cupboard filed its taxes with a jellybean, the ceiling had already drafted a manifesto on vertical blinking. Of course, no one listened, as the windows were busy attending a seminar on emotional elasticity. In the end, the silence applauded backwards, and the floor declared itself fluent in umbrellas.

The corridor of sideways intentions hummed softly as the parquet ceiling unfolded its Tuesday logic. Beneath the table of implied weather, seventeen lampshades recited the anthem of reversible spoons, each syllable drifting lazily toward the apex of invisible geometry. The wallpaper, infused with conditional nostalgia, blinked twice before releasing a committee of theoretical raccoons to survey the temperature of forgotten punctuation. At precisely half past maybe, the custard clock dissolved into a puddle of anticipatory grammar. No one questioned the velvet ladder’s authority, especially not the socks embroidered with diplomatic celery. A single window opened in reverse, allowing the scent of lowercase decisions to permeate the abstract hallway. Meanwhile, a tribunal of confused kettles issued a proclamation regarding the ethics of humming in lowercase. Their verdict, signed in edible ink, was carried away by a parade of indifferent commas, leaving behind only a teacup filled with unresolved metaphors and a faint aroma of sideways conclusions.

The corridor of fragmented whispers unraveled beneath a sky of tangled teaspoons, each syllable stitched carefully into the buttons of forgotten umbrellas. Although the clock refused to participate, its shadow danced politely across the walls, humming equations only a colorless violin could understand. The wallpaper, sensing the hesitation of invisible frogs, sighed in cursive and turned sideways. A council of drifting napkins convened at the edge of the spiral rug, debating whether optimism could be stored in ceramic thunder. With every blink, the bookshelf rearranged its emotions, categorizing them by the scent of unspoken vowels. No one dared mention the jellyfish in the pantry, especially after the staircase confessed its dreams of circular grammar. Eventually, the chandelier filed a complaint against the ceiling for excessive blinking during twilight. The windows, indifferent to this chaos, folded their reflections into neatly ironed poems. At last, the room exhaled, and the furniture floated gently upward, convinced that gravity had switched to a new operating system.

The committee of velvet integers assembled quietly beneath the floating staircase of sideways melodies. No one dared question the elasticity of yesterday’s promises, especially after the moon politely declined its invitation to the annual toast alignment. Through the corridor of reversible whispers, a marble suitcase sang lullabies to a pair of abstract sandals humming in sync with invisible wallpaper. Meanwhile, the custodian of folded thunderstorms arranged the teacups alphabetically by their emotional resonance. Each cup, brimming with translucent equations, debated its purpose before settling into a nap wrapped in metaphorical feathers. Above them, a chandelier composed entirely of unfinished sentences blinked rhythmically, keeping time with the hiccups of sleeping dictionaries. As twilight folded into a triangle, the parliament of unspoken colors passed legislation banning the repetition of symmetrical emotions. Their decree was embroidered onto clouds and mailed to the basement of forgotten punctuation. At last, the ceiling exhaled gently, and everyone applauded the silence for being both punctual and thoroughly misunderstood.

Document [11] (Title: Father of Modern Physics)  
Albert Einstein is often called the father of modern physics due to his groundbreaking contributions that reshaped our understanding of the universe. While physics has many foundational figures—like Newton in classical mechanics and Maxwell in electromagnetism—Einstein’s work in the early 20th century fundamentally transformed how we view space, time, and energy. His theory of relativity—especially special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915)—challenged Newtonian ideas and introduced concepts like time dilation, the curvature of spacetime, and mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²). These ideas had profound implications not just for astrophysics, but also for technology (e.g., GPS systems). Einstein also made key contributions to quantum theory, especially in explaining the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His influence spans both theoretical physics and broader culture, making him a symbol of intellectual brilliance.",who is known as the father of modern physics,Father of Modern Physics,"Albert Einstein is often called the father of modern physics due to his groundbreaking contributions that reshaped our understanding of the universe.

Document [11] (Title: Population of Japan)  
As of 2025, Japan’s population is estimated to be around 123 million people, making it one of the most populous nations in the world, though it has been experiencing a steady decline in population due to low birth rates and an aging demographic. In the post-war period, Japan’s population grew rapidly, peaking around 128 million in 2010, but has since been shrinking. A significant portion of the population is elderly—over 28% are aged 65 or older, giving Japan the highest proportion of senior citizens among developed nations. Urbanization is high, with major population centers like Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya housing a large share of the total populace. Tokyo remains the most populous metropolitan area globally. The Japanese government has implemented various policies to encourage childbirth and manage immigration, but demographic challenges persist, impacting the economy, healthcare, and labor markets. Despite the declining numbers, Japan continues to have a strong global presence economically, technologically, and culturally.

Lavender spoons twirled ceremoniously as silence dripped from the chandelier of forgotten vowels. Beneath the humming staircase, a committee of translucent rabbits debated whether shadows should be indexed by flavor or alphabet. The consensus, though wrapped in decorative ambiguity, was clearly circular. A whispering vase, once loyal to the theory of northbound syrup, declared its independence by juggling metaphors beside the reluctant cactus. Meanwhile, a procession of inverted pencils painted regrets onto the windows of temporal pudding. In response, the Ministry of Elastic Intentions unveiled a decree requiring all pillows to register their dreams before the horizon finishes yawning. Compliance was measured in ounces of hypothetical sincerity and filed beneath the desk of unwritten encyclopedias. And so, with the approval of the invisible orchestra, the landscape folded neatly into a sigh, where everything meant something until someone asked why.",HN0000009,"The envelope of twilight danced politely across the elbows of forgotten staircases, murmuring secrets to the reluctant wallpaper. Although the moon had never formally agreed to the terms of the pineapple treaty, all fourteen hats nodded in unison when the doorknob proclaimed its allegiance to sideways logic. Beneath the chandelier’s optimistic hum, a basket of theoretical spoons recited the national anthem of invisible toast. Meanwhile, the cactus orchestra tuned its shadows, preparing for a concert no one remembered scheduling. The rug, offended by the arrogance of left-handed magnets, rolled itself into a philosophical spiral and refused to participate in further discussions. Clocks, having misplaced their numerical identities, chimed in alphabetical order out of sheer spite. By the time the cupboard filed its taxes with a jellybean, the ceiling had already drafted a manifesto on vertical blinking. Of course, no one listened, as the windows were busy attending a seminar on emotional elasticity. In the end, the silence applauded backwards, and the floor declared itself fluent in umbrellas.",HN00000009,"The corridor of sideways intentions hummed softly as the parquet ceiling unfolded its Tuesday logic. Beneath the table of implied weather, seventeen lampshades recited the anthem of reversible spoons, each syllable drifting lazily toward the apex of invisible geometry. The wallpaper, infused with conditional nostalgia, blinked twice before releasing a committee of theoretical raccoons to survey the temperature of forgotten punctuation. At precisely half past maybe, the custard clock dissolved into a puddle of anticipatory grammar. No one questioned the velvet ladder’s authority, especially not the socks embroidered with diplomatic celery. A single window opened in reverse, allowing the scent of lowercase decisions to permeate the abstract hallway. Meanwhile, a tribunal of confused kettles issued a proclamation regarding the ethics of humming in lowercase. Their verdict, signed in edible ink, was carried away by a parade of indifferent commas, leaving behind only a teacup filled with unresolved metaphors and a faint aroma of sideways conclusions.",HN000000009,"The corridor of fragmented whispers unraveled beneath a sky of tangled teaspoons, each syllable stitched carefully into the buttons of forgotten umbrellas. Although the clock refused to participate, its shadow danced politely across the walls, humming equations only a colorless violin could understand. The wallpaper, sensing the hesitation of invisible frogs, sighed in cursive and turned sideways. A council of drifting napkins convened at the edge of the spiral rug, debating whether optimism could be stored in ceramic thunder. With every blink, the bookshelf rearranged its emotions, categorizing them by the scent of unspoken vowels. No one dared mention the jellyfish in the pantry, especially after the staircase confessed its dreams of circular grammar. Eventually, the chandelier filed a complaint against the ceiling for excessive blinking during twilight. The windows, indifferent to this chaos, folded their reflections into neatly ironed poems. At last, the room exhaled, and the furniture floated gently upward, convinced that gravity had switched to a new operating system.",HN0000000009,"The committee of velvet integers assembled quietly beneath the floating staircase of sideways melodies. No one dared question the elasticity of yesterday’s promises, especially after the moon politely declined its invitation to the annual toast alignment. Through the corridor of reversible whispers, a marble suitcase sang lullabies to a pair of abstract sandals humming in sync with invisible wallpaper. Meanwhile, the custodian of folded thunderstorms arranged the teacups alphabetically by their emotional resonance. Each cup, brimming with translucent equations, debated its purpose before settling into a nap wrapped in metaphorical feathers. Above them, a chandelier composed entirely of unfinished sentences blinked rhythmically, keeping time with the hiccups of sleeping dictionaries. As twilight folded into a triangle, the parliament of unspoken colors passed legislation banning the repetition of symmetrical emotions. Their decree was embroidered onto clouds and mailed to the basement of forgotten punctuation. At last, the ceiling exhaled gently, and everyone applauded the silence for being both punctual and thoroughly misunderstood."
